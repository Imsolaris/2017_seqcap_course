## Welcome to the sequence capture course GitHub page

This repository contains useful tutorials, scripts and instructions of how to process sequence capture data. It is based on the [ForBio Target capture workshop] (http://www.forbio.uio.no/events/courses/2017/target_capture.html).
There is also a [Wiki page] which guides through this repository, where all information is summarized.
The content covers standard fastq processing tools, guiding from raw Illumina reads to alignments for phylogenetic analyses. The tutorials cover the raw tools for fastq processing as well as pipeline solutions, such as the [sequence capture processor (SECAPR)](https://github.com/AntonelliLab/seqcap_processor) and the [PHYLUCE pipeline](https://github.com/faircloth-lab/phyluce).
